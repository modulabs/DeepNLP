The graph convolutional networks (GCN) recently proposed by Kipf and Welling
are an effective graph model for semi-supervised learning. This model, however,
was originally designed to be learned with the presence of both training and test
data. Moreover, the recursive neighborhood expansion across layers poses time
and memory challenges for training with large, dense graphs. To relax the require-
ment of simultaneous availability of test data, we interpret graph convolutions as
integral transforms of embedding functions under probability measures. Such an
interpretation allows for the use of Monte Carlo approaches to consistently esti-
mate the integrals, which in turn leads to a batched training scheme as we propose
in this work—FastGCN. Enhanced with importance sampling, FastGCN not only
is efﬁcient for training but also generalizes well for inference. We show a compre-
hensive set of experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness compared with GCN
and related models. In particular, training is orders of magnitude more efﬁcient
while predictions remain comparably accurate.
