Rademacher complexity is often used to characterize the learn-
ability of a hypothesis class and is known to be related to the
class size. We leverage this observation and introduce a new
technique for estimating the size of an arbitrary weighted set,
deﬁned as the sum of weights of all elements in the set. Our
technique provides upper and lower bounds on a novel gener-
alization of Rademacher complexity to the weighted setting
in terms of the weighted set size. This generalizes Massart’s
Lemma, a known upper bound on the Rademacher complexity
in terms of the unweighted set size. We show that the weighted
Rademacher complexity can be estimated by solving a ran-
domly perturbed optimization problem, allowing us to derive
high-probability bounds on the size of any weighted set. We
apply our method to the problems of calculating the parti-
tion function of an Ising model and computing propositional
model counts (#SAT). Our experiments demonstrate that we
can produce tighter bounds than competing methods in both
the weighted and unweighted settings.
