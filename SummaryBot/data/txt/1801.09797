ABSTRACT
Recurrent models for sequences have been recently successful at many tasks, es-
pecially for language modeling and machine translation. Nevertheless, it remains
challenging to extract good representations from these models. For instance, even
though language has a clear hierarchical structure going from characters through
words to sentences, it is not apparent in current language models. We propose to
improve the representation in sequence models by augmenting current approaches
with an autoencoder that is forced to compress the sequence through an inter-
mediate discrete latent space.
In order to propagate gradients though this dis-
crete representation we introduce an improved semantic hashing technique. We
show that this technique performs well on a newly proposed quantitative efﬁ-
ciency measure. We also analyze latent codes produced by the model showing
how they correspond to words and phrases. Finally, we present an application of
the autoencoder-augmented model to generating diverse translations.
INTRODUCTION
long history in deep learning (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006;
Autoencoders have
Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009a; Vincent et al., 2010; Kingma & Welling, 2013).
In most
cases, autoencoders operate on continuous representations, either by simply making a bottleneck
(Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006), denoising (Vincent et al., 2010), or adding a variational compo-
nent (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In many cases though, a discrete latent representation is potentially
a better ﬁt.
Language is inherently discrete, and autoregressive models based on sequences of discrete symbols
yield impressive results. A discrete representation can be fed into a reasoning or planning system
or act as a bridge towards any other part of a larger system. Even in reinforcement learning where
action spaces are naturally continuous, Metz et al. (2017) show that discretizing them and using
autoregressive models can yield improvements.
Unluckily, using discrete latent variables is challenging in deep learning. And even with continuous
autoencoders, the interactions with an autoregressive component cause difﬁculties. Despite some
success (Bowman et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017), the task of meaningfully autoencoding text in the
presence of an autoregressive decoder has remained a challenge.
In this work we present an architecture that autoencodes a sequence s of N discrete symbols from
any vocabulary (e.g., a tokenized sentence), into a K-fold (we test K = 8 and K = 32) compressed
sequence c(s) of ⌈ N
K ⌉ latent symbols from a new vocabulary which is learned. The compressed
sequence is generated to minimize perplexity in a (possibly conditional) language model trained to
predict the next token on c(s) ◦ s: the concatenation of c(s) with the original sequence s.
Since gradient signals can vanish when propagating over discrete variables, the compression func-
tion c(s) can be hard to train. To solve this problem, we draw from the old technique of seman-
tic hashing (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009b). There, to discretize a dense vector v one computes
σ(v + n) where σ is the sigmoid function and n represents annealed Gaussian noise that pushes the
network to not use middle values in v. We enhance this method by using a saturating sigmoid and
a straight-through pass with only bits passed forward. These techniques, described in detail below,
allow to forgo the annealing of the noise and provide a stable discretization mechanism that requires
neither annealing nor additional loss factors.
We test our discretization technique by amending language models over s with the autoencoded
sequence c(s). We compare the perplexity achieved on s with and without the c(s) component,
and contrast this value with the number of bits used in c(s). We argue that this number is a proper
measure for the performance of a discrete autoencoder.
It is easy to compute and captures the
performance of the autoencoding part of the model. This quantitative measure allows us to compare
the technique we introduce with other methods, and we show that it performs better than a Gumbel-
Softmax (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016) in this context.
Finally, we discuss the use of adding the autoencoded part c(s) to a sequence model. We present
samples from a character-level language model and show that the latent symbols correspond to
words and phrases when the architecture of c(s) is local. ehen, we introduce a decoding method in
which c(s) is sampled and then s is decoded using beam search. This method alleviates a number
of problems observed with beam search or pure sampling. We show how our decoding method can
be used to obtain diverse translations of a sentence from a neural machine translation model. To
summarize, the main contributions of this paper are:
(1) a discretization technique that works well without any extra losses or parameters to tune,
(2) a way to measure performance of autoencoders for sequence models with baselines,
(3) an improved way to sample from sequence models trained with an autoencoder part.
2 TECHNIQUES
Below, we introduce our discretization method, the autoencoding function c(s) and ﬁnally the com-
plete model that we use for our experiments. All code and hyperparameter settings needed to repli-
cate our experiments are available as open-source1.
2.1 DISCRETIZATION BY IMPROVED SEMANTIC HASHING
As already mentioned above, our discretization method stems
from semantic hashing
(Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009b). To discretize a b-dimensional vector v, we ﬁrst add noise, so
vn = v + n. The noise n is drawn from a b-dimensional Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 1 (deviations between 0 and 1.5 all work ﬁne, see ablations below). The sum is
component-wise, as are all operations below. Note that noise is used only for training, during evalua-
tion and inference n = 0. From vn we compute two vectors: v1 = σ′(vn) and v2 = (vn < 0), where
σ′ is the saturating sigmoid function from (Kaiser & Sutskever, 2016; Kaiser & Bengio, 2016):
σ′(x) = max(0, min(1, 1.2σ(x) − 0.1)).
The vector v2 represents the discretized value of v and is used for evaluation and inference. During
training, in the forward pass we use v1 half of the time and v2 the other half. In the backward pass,
we let gradients always ﬂow to v1, even if we used v2 in the forward computation2.
We will denote the vector v discretized in the above way by vd. Note that if v is b-dimensional then
vd will have b bits. Since in other parts of the system we will predict vd with a softmax, we want
the number of bits to not be too large. In our experiments we stick with b = 16, so vd is a vector of
16 bits, and so can be interpreted as an integer between 0 and 216 − 1 = 65535.
The dense vectors representing activations in our sequence models have much larger dimen-
sionality than 16 (often 512, see the details in the experimental section below). To discretize
such a high-dimensional vector w we ﬁrst have a simple fully-connected layer converting it into
v = dense(w, 16). In our notation, dense(x, n) denotes a fully-connected layer applied to x and
mapping it into n dimensions, i.e., dense(x, n) = xW + B where W is a learned matrix of shape
d × n, where d is the dimensionality of x, and B is a learned bias vector of size n. The discretized
vector vd is converted back into a high-dimensional vector using a 3-layer feed-forward network:
h1a = dense(vd, filter_size)
h1b = dense(1.0 - vd, filter_size)
1See transformer vae.py in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor
2This can be done in TensorFlow using: v2 += v1 - tf.stop gradient(v1).
h2 = dense(relu(h1a + h1b), filter_size)
result = dense(relu(h2), hidden_size)
Above, every time we apply dense we create a new weight matrix an bias to be learned. The relu
function is deﬁned in the standard way: relu(x) = max(x, 0). In the network above, we usually
use a large filter size; in our experiments we set it to 4096 while hidden size was usually
512. We suspect that this allows the above network to recover from the discretization bottleneck by
simulating the distribution of w encountered during training. Given a dense, high-dimensional vector
w we will denote the corresponding result returned from the network above by bottleneck(w)
and the corresponding discrete vector v2 by discrete(w).
2.2 GUMBEL-SOFTMAX FOR DISCRETIZATION
As an alternative discretization method, we consider the recently studied Gumbel-Softmax
(Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016). In that case, given a vector w we compute discreteg(w)
by applying a linear layer mapping into 216 elements, resulting in the logits l. During evaluation
and inference we simply pick the index of l with maximum value for discreteg(w) and the vector
bottleneckg(w) is computed by an embedding. During training we ﬁrst draw samples g from the
Gumbel distribution: g ∼ − log(− log(u)), where u ∼ U(0, 1) are uniform samples. Then, as in
(Jang et al., 2016), we compute x, the log-softmax of l, and set:
yi =
exp((xi + gi)/τ )
Pi exp((xi + gi)/τ
With low temperature τ this vector is close to the 1-hot vector representing the maximum index of l.
But with higher temperature, it is an approximation (see Figure 1 in Jang et al. (2016)). We multiply
this vector y by the embedding matrix to compute bottleneckg(w) during training.
2.3 AUTOENCODING FUNCTION
Having the functions bottleneck(w) and discrete(w) (respectively their Gumbel-Softmax versions),
we can now describe the architecture of the autoencoding function c(s). We assume that s is already
a sequence of dense vectors, e.g., coming from embedding vectors from a tokenized sentence. To
halve the size of s, we ﬁrst apply to it 3 layers of 1-dimensional convolutions with kernel size 3 and
padding with 0s on both sides (SAME-padding). We use ReLU non-linearities between the layers
and layer-normalization (Ba et al., 2016). Then, we add the input to the result, forming a residual
block. Finally, we process the result with a convolution with kernel size 2 and stride 2, effectively
halving the size of s. In the local version of this function we only do the ﬁnal strided convolution,
without the residual block.
To autoencode a sequence s and shorten it K-fold, with K = 2k, we ﬁrst apply the above step
k times obtaining a sequence s′ that is K times shorter. Then we put it through the discretization
bottleneck described above. The ﬁnal compression function is given by c(s) = bottleneck(s′) and
the architecture described above is depicted in Figure 1.
Note that, since we perform 3 convolutions with kernel 3 in each step, the network has access to a
large context: 3 · 2k−1 just from the receptive ﬁelds of convolutions in the last step. That’s why we
also consider the local version. With only strided convolutions, the i-th symbol in the local c(s) has
only access to a ﬁxed 2k symbols from the sequence s and can only compress them.
Training with c(s) deﬁned above from scratch is hard, since at the beginning of training s′ is
generated by many layers of untrained convolutions that are only getting gradients through the
discretization bottleneck. To help training, we add a side-path for c(s) without discretization:
we just use c(s) = s′ for the ﬁrst 10000 training steps.
In this pretraining stage the network
reaches loss of almost 0 as everything needed to reconstruct s is encoded in s′. After switching
to c(s) = bottleneck(s′) the loss is high again and improves during further training.
2.4 AUTOENCODING SEQUENCE MODEL
To test the autoencoding function c(s) we will use it to preﬁx the sequence s in a sequence model.
Normally, a sequence model would generate the i-th element of s conditioning on all elements of

s before that, s<i, and possibly on some other inputs. For example, a language model would just
condition on s<i while a neural machine translation model would condition on the input sentence (in
the other language) and s<i. We do not change the sequence models in any way other than adding
the sequence c(s) as the preﬁx of s. Actually, for reasons analogous to those in (Sutskever et al.,
2014), we ﬁrst reverse the sequence c(s), then add a separator symbol (#), and only then concatenate
it with s, as depicted in Figure 2. We also use a separate set of parameters for the model predicting
c(s) so as to make sure that the models predicting s with and without c(s) have the same capacity.
As the architecture for the sequence model we use the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Trans-
former is based on multiple attention layers and was originally introduced in the context of neural
machine translation. We focused on the autoencoding function c(s) and did not tune the sequence
model in this work: we used all the defaults from the baseline provided by the Transformer authors
(6 layers, hidden size of 512 and ﬁlter size of 4096) and only varied parameters relevant to c(s).
3 EXPERIMENTS
We experimented with autoencoding on 3 different sequence tasks: (1) on a character-level language
model, (2) on a word-level language model, and (3) on a word-level translation model. The goal for
(1) was to check if our technique works at all, since character sequences are naturally amenable
to compression into shorter sequences of objects from a larger vocabulary. For (2), we wanted to
check if the good results obtained in (1) will still hold if the input is from a larger vocabulary and
inherently more compressed space. Finally, in (3) we want to check if this method is applicable to
conditional models and how it can be used to improve decoding.
We use the LM1B corpus (Chelba et al., 2013) for language modelling and we tokenize it using a
subword (wordpiece) tokenizer (Sennrich et al., 2016) into a vocabulary of 32000 words and word-
pieces. For translation, we use the WMT English-German corpus, similarly tokenized into a vocab-
ulary of 32000 words and word-pieces3.

Table 1: Log-perplexities per word of sequence models with and without autoencoders, and their
autoencoding efﬁciency. Results for Gumbel-Softmax heavily depend on tuning; see text for details.
Below we report both qualitative and quantitative results. First, we focus on measuring the perfor-
mance of our autoencoder quantitatively. To do that, we introduce a measure of discrete autoen-
coder performance on sequence tasks and compare our semantic hashing based method to Gumbel-
Softmax on this scale.
3.1 DISCRETE SEQUENCE AUTOENCODING EFFICIENCY
Sequence models trained for next-symbol prediction are usually trained (and often also evaluated)
based on the perplexity per token that they reach. Perplexity is deﬁned as 2H , where H is the
entropy (in bits) of a distribution. Therefore, a language model that reaches a per-word perplexity
of p, say p = 32, on a sentence s can be said to compress each word from s into log(p) = 5 bits of
information.
Let us now assume that this model is allowed to access some additional bits of information about s
before decoding. In our autoencoding case, we let it peek at c(s) before decoding s, and c(s) has
K = 8 times less symbols and b = 16 bits in each symbol. So c(s) has the information capacity
of 2 bits per word. If our autoencoder was perfectly aligned with the needs of the language model,
then allowing it to peek into c(s) would lower its information needs by these 2 bits per word. The
perplexity p′ of the model with access to c(s) would thus satisfy log2(p′) = 5 − 2 = 3, so its
perplexity would be p′ = 8.
Getting the autoencoder c(s) perfectly aligned with the language model is hard, so in practice the
perplexity p′ is always higher. But since we measure it (and optimize for it during training), we
can calculate how many bits has the c(s) part actually contributed to lowering the perplexity. We
calculate log2(p) − log2(p′) and then, if c(s) is K-times shorter than s and uses b bits, we deﬁne the
discrete sequence autoencoding efﬁciency as:
DSAE =
K(log2(p) − log2(p′))
K(ln(p) − ln(p′))
b ln(2)
The second formulation is useful when the raw numbers are given as natural logarithms, as is often
the case during neural networks training.
Deﬁned in this way, DSAE measures how many of the available bits in c(s) are actually used well
by the model that peeks into the autoencoded part. Note that some models may have autoencod-
ing capacity higher than the number of bits per word that log(p) indicates. In that case achieving
DSAE=1 is impossible even if log(p′) = 0 and the autoencoding is perfect. One should be careful
when reporting DSAE for such over-capacitated models.
So how does our method perform on DSAE and how does it compare with Gumbel-Softmax? In Ta-
ble 1 we list log-perplexties of baseline and autoencoder models. We report numbers for the global
version of c(s) on our 3 problems and compare it to Gumbel-Softmax on word-level problems. We
did not manage to run the Gumbel-Softmax on character-level data in our baseline conﬁguration
because it requires too much memory (as it needs to learn the embeddings for each latent discrete
symbol). Also, we found that the results for Gumbel-Softmax heavily depend on how the tempera-
ture parameter τ is annealed during training. We tuned this on 5 runs of a smaller model and chose
the best conﬁguration. This was still not enough, as in many runs the Gumbel-Softmax would only
utilize a small portion of the discrete symbols. We added an extra loss term to increase the variance
of the Gumbel-Softmax and ran another 5 tuning runs to optimize this loss term. We used the best

conﬁguration for the experiments above. Still, we did not manage to get any information autoen-
coded in the translation model, and got only 12% efﬁciency in the language model (see Table 1).
Our method, on the other hand, was most efﬁcient on character-level language modeling, where
we reach almost 60% efﬁciency, and it retained high 55% efﬁciency on the word-level language
modeling task. On the translation task, our efﬁciency goes down to 19%, possibly because the c(s)
function does not take inputs into account, and so may not be able to compress the right parts to align
with the conditional model that outputs s depending on the inputs. But even with 19% efﬁciency it
is still useful for sampling from the model, as shown below.
3.2 SENSITIVITY TO NOISE
To make sure that our autoencoding method is stable, we experiment with different standard devi-
ations for the noise n in the semantic hashing part. We perform these experiments on word-level
language modelling with a smaller model conﬁguration (3 layers, hidden size of 384 and ﬁlter size
of 2048). The results, presented in Table 2, show that our method is robust to the amount of noise.
Interestingly, we see that our method works even without any noise (standard deviation 0.0). We
suspect that this is due to the fact that half of the time in the forward computation we use the
discrete values anyway and pass gradients through to the dense part. Also, note that a standard
deviation of 1.5 still works, despite the fact that our saturating sigmoid is saturated for values above
2.4 as 1.2 · σ(2.4) − 0.1 = 1.0002. Finally, with deviation 1.0 the small model achieves DSAE of
48.5%, not much worse than the 55% achieved by the large baseline model and better than the larger
baseline model with Gumbel-Softmax.
3.3 DECIPHERING THE LATENT CODE
Having trained the models, we try to ﬁnd out whether the discrete latent symbols have any inter-
pretable meaning. We start by asking a simpler question: do the latent symbols correspond to some
ﬁxed phrases or topics?
We ﬁrst investigate this in a 32-fold compressed character-level language model. We set c(s) to 4
random latent symbols [l1, l2, l3, l4] and decode s with beam search, obtaining:
All goods are subject to the Member States’
environmental and security aspects of the common
agricultural policy.
Now, to ﬁnd out whether the second symbol in c(s) stands for anything ﬁxed, we replace the third
symbol by the second one, hoping for some phrase to be repeated. Indeed, decoding s from the new
c(s) = [l1, l2, l2, l4] with beam search we obtain:
All goods are charged EUR 50.00 per night and EUR
50.00 per night stay per night.
Note that the beginning of the sentence remained the same, as we did not change the ﬁrst symbol,
and we see a repetition of EUR 50.00 per night. Could it be that this is what that second latent
symbol stands for? But there were no EUR in the ﬁrst sentence. Let us try again, now changing the
ﬁrst symbol to a different one. With c(s) = [l5, l2, l2, l4] the decoded s is:
All bedrooms suited to the large suite of the large
living room suites are available.
We see a repetition again, but of a different phrase. So we are forced to conclude that the latent code
is structured, the meaning of the latent symbols can depend on other symbols before them.
Failing to decipher the code from this model, we try again with an 8-fold compressed character-level
language model that uses the local version of the function c(s). Recall (see Section 2.3) that a local
function c(s) with 8-fold compression generates every latent symbol from the exact 8 symbols that
correspond to it in s, without any context. With this simpler c(s) the model has lower DSAE, 35%,
but we expect the latent symbols to be more context-independent. And indeed: if we pick the ﬁrst 2
latent symbols at random but ﬁx the third, fourth and ﬁfth to be the same, we obtain the following:
It’s studio, rather after a gallery gallery ...
When prices or health after a gallery gallery ...
I still offer hotels at least gallery gallery ...
So the ﬁxed latent symbol corresponds to the word gallery in various contexts. Let us now ignore
context-dependence, ﬁx the ﬁrst three symbols, and randomly choose another one that we repeat
after them. Here are a few sample decodes:
Come to earth and culturalized climate climate ...
Come together that contribution itself, itself, ...
Come to learn that countless threat this gas threat...
In the ﬁrst two samples we see that the latent symbol corresponds to climate or itself, respectively.
Note that all these words or phrases are 7-characters long (and one character for space), most proba-
bly due to the architecture of c(s). But in the last sample we see a different phenomenon: the latent
symbol seems to correspond to X threat, where X depends on the context, showing that this latent
code also has an interesting structure.
3.4 MIXED SAMPLE-BEAM DECODING
From the results above we know that our discretization method works quantitatively and we see
interesting patterns in the latent code. But how can we use the autoencoder models in practice?
One well-known problem with autoregressive sequence models is decoding. In settings where the
possible outputs are fairly restricted, such as translation, one can obtain good results with beam
search. But results obtained by beam search lack diversity (Vijayakumar et al., 2016). Sampling can
improve diversity, but it can introduce artifacts or even change semantics in translation. We present
an example of this problem in Figure 3. We pick an English sentence from the validation set of our
English-German dataset and translate it using beam search and sampling (left and middle columns).
In the left column, we show top 3 results from beam search using our baseline model (without
autoencoder). It is not necessary to speak German to see that they are all very similar; the only
difference between the ﬁrst and the last one are the spaces before ”%”. Further beams are also like
this, providing no real diversity.
In the middle column we show 3 results sampled from the baseline model. There is more diversity
in them, but they still share most of the ﬁrst half and unluckily all of them actually changed the
semantics of the sentence in the second half. The part African-Americans, who accounted however
for only 13% of voters in the State becomes The american voters were only 13% of voters in the
state in the ﬁrst case, African-Americans, who accounted however for only 13% of all people in the
State in the second one, and African-Americans, who elected only 13% of people in the State in the
third case. This illustrates the dangers of just sampling different words during decoding.
Using a model with access to the autoencoded part c(s) presents us with another option: sample
c(s) and then run beam search for the sequence s appropriate for that c(s). In this way we do not
introduce low-level artifacts from sampling, but still preserve high-level diversity. To sample c(s) we
train a language model on c(s) with the same architecture as the model for s (and also conditioned
on the input), but with a different set of weights. We then use the standard multinomial sampling
from this model to obtain c(s) and run a beam search on the model for s with the sampled c(s).

In the right column in Figure 3 we show 3 samples obtained in this way. As you can see, these
samples are much more diverse and they still preserve the semantics of the original sentence, even
if with sometimes strange syntax. One would back-translate the ﬁrst example as: In turned out, for

4 CONCLUSION
In this work, the study of text autoencoders (Bowman et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017) is combined
with the research on discrete autoencoders (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016). It turns out
that the semantic hashing technique (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009b) can be improved and then
yields good results in this context. We introduce a measure of efﬁciency of discrete autoencoders in
sequence models and show that improved semantic hashing has over 50% efﬁciency. In some cases,
we can decipher the latent code, showing that latent symbols correspond to words and phrases. On
the practical side, sampling from the latent code and then running beam search allows to get valid
but highly diverse samples, an important problem with beam search (Vijayakumar et al., 2016).
We leave a number of questions open for future work. How does the architecture of the function
c(s) affect the latent code? How can we further improve discrete sequence autoencoding efﬁciency?
Despite remaining questions, we can already see potential applications of discrete sequence autoen-
coders. One is the training of multi-scale generative models end-to-end, opening a way to generating
truly realistic images, audio and video. Another application is in reinforcement learning. Using la-
tent code may allow the agents to plan in larger time scales and explore more efﬁciently by sampling
from high-level latent actions instead of just atomic moves.
